	      <p>
		One of my favorite card games is Dominion. A deck building game, players
		take turns playing action cards in an attempt to get more treasure in their hand,
		and then use that treasure to buy cards. Certain cards you can buy are worth more
		Victory Points, and whoever has the most VP at the end wins. It is a simple concept,
		but with approximately 535 unique action cards and 10 action cards per game, that
		gives us 1.7 x 10<sup>27</sup> unique possible games, other game modifiers
		notwithstanding. This presents itself as challenging project for building an AI
		model that can make decisions on what cards to play and purchase.

	      <h3>Deck Analysis GUI</h3>
	      <p>
		Given the challenges of analyzing choices in the changing environment as a player
		builds their deck, I build a deck analysis Graphical User Interface to assist
		with debugging and building the AI. It allows the user to construct a Kingdom
		(set of cards used in a game), and from that Kingdom move cards between the
		player's Hand (H), Draw pile (D), Discard pile (X), and the Play area (P).
		It updates and displays tracked stats used by the model, and provides a
		recommendation of which card to play based on a Markov Decision Process.

	      <h3>Next steps</h3>
	      <p>
		Within the framework of the game, there are 4 elements the AI must be able to accomplish:
		buying, playing actions, discarding, and trashing. Trashing, discarding, and playing actions
		can be accomplished algorithmically. At present, there are simple stand in algorithms
		that the AI uses for discarding and trashing based on simple prioritizing attributes
		of a card. The playing of actions has been implemented using a Markov Decision Process
		to optimize play attributes, primarily treasure.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The hardest component by far is still under development - deciding which cards to buy.
		Given the 1.7 x 10<sup>27</sup> possible unique games, this model will need to consider
		multiple card attributes in it's decision making. To accurately train the model, the
		discarding and trashing attributes will need to be clearly flushed out. The benchmark
		strategy is the Big Money strategy: only buying money or victory points. This strategy
		averages out owning 4 provinces by turn 17, and is playable in every Kingdom, so any model
		must outperform 4 provinces by turn 17 to be considered successful.
