	      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
	      <p>
		The game is first set up by drawing 10 random action cards. Those action cards,
		combined with decks of copper, silver, gold, estate, duchy, and province
		cards form the Kingdom. Players start with 7 copper and 3 estates, and shuffle
		them into their draw pile.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Each player's turn starts with their action phase, where they may play action cards.
		Some cards may give the player additional actions, cards, buys, or treasure. Many
		cards also have special and unique abilities, such as discarding cards or trashing
		them. At the end of the action phase, the player enters their buy phase, where they
		can purchase a card based on the amount of treasure they possess this turn. Finally,
		the player enters the clean-up phase, where they discard all cards in the play area
		and remaining in their hand, and draw 5 new cards from their draw pile.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The game ends when either the province pile runs out of cards, or any three piles run
		out of cards. At this point the player with the most points win. If there is a tie, the
		player with the fewest number of turns wins.
