	      <h2>Character Vision</h2>
	      <p>
		One of the vital character parameters is the vision. The vision object creates a set
		of rays oriented at different angles on either side of the characters orientation.
		The user can provide the center of these group of rays, and the total field of view.
		IE, if the user provides a FOV of 90 degrees, offset of 45 degrees, and 9 rays, the rays
		will all have a width of 10 degrees, and the "left" rays will be centered on (left to right)
		[85,75,65,55,45,35,25,15,5] degrees, and the "right" rays centered on
		[355,345,335,325,315,305,295,285,275] degrees. Any named object that the character can see
		that intersects one of these rays will be placed within it, and the closest values are
		used to determine changes in behavior.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		With the vision object, we can pair it with a Multi Layered Perceptron to train the
		predator and prey behavior, by outputting changes to speed and orientation as the final
		layer. We do this using a simple MLP to ensure we capture intended behavior or turning
		towards food, avoiding collisions, and avoiding predators. We later those combine those with a
		MLP to construct a much stronger neural network that can weigh these decisions against
		each other.
	      </p>

	      <h2>Training Simple Behavior</h2>
	      <p>
		We first use reinforcement learning to train basic behavior into our characters.
		The most obvious of these is to encourage our characters to move towards food.
		In the case of prey, this is the static food sources. We devise a rule set based on the
		following principles:
		<UL>
		  <LI>If there is no food visible, turn slightly and increase speed to find it.
		  <LI>If there is food in our heading, increase speed towards the food.
		  <LI>If there is no food in our heading and food slightly off our heading, turn towards it.
		  <LI>If there is no food near our front but food to the side, decrease speed and turn towards it.
		</UL>
		Looking at the results:
	      </p>

	      <img src="/pred_prey/images/pp_food.gif" 
                width="800" 
		   />

	      <p>
		We do see the desired behavior. There is some funny circling that can occur if the
		food source is hit from a slight angle, but this is ok. We don't want to sit stationary
		in the food source, as we want to give opportunity to see predators. There is a clear
		problem however with collisions, which we don't want. So, on to our next behavior test.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		We want to avoid collisions, so we must train behavior to avoid similar characters
		when we will collide. This is a simpler rule set:
		<UL>
		  <LI>If there is a character of the same name very close and in our heading, turn away and heavily decrease speed.
		  <LI>If there is a character of the same name very close and not in our heading, turn away.
		</UL>
		Here, our results look like:
	      </p>

	      <img src="/pred_prey/images/pp_avoid_self.gif" 
                width="800" 
		   />

	      <p>
		Success! These results clearly show cases of the prey avoiding other prey.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Finally, we arrive at the final simple behavior to test - flee from predators.
		These rules are:
		<UL>
		  <LI>If our predator is in our heading, heavily decrease speed and turn hard.
		  <LI>If our predator is near our heading, decrease speed and turn hard.
		  <LI>If our predator is near 45 degrees from our heading, turn.
		  <LI>If our predator is greater than 45 degrees from our heading, turn and speed up.
		</UL>
		These results lie below:
	      </p>

	      <img src="/pred_prey/images/pp_avoid_predators.gif" 
                width="800" 
		   />

	      <p>
		Another successful test! We use dummy predators in red that move at a constant speed,
		and see the prey reacting to the presence of predators in their vision.
