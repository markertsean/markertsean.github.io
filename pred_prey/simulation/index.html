	      <h2>Simulation Box Object</h2>
	      <p>
		My experience in theoretical astrophysics working with big bang simulations
		proved vital for making an efficient simulation box object. Knowing how to
		reduce the number of calculations performed and how to safely parallelize processes
		are required for efficient programming of this kind.
                <!-- <a href="/number_recognition/exploration">Data Exploration</a>. -->
              </p>
	      <p>
		The simulations box is an open box object that we embed the character object in.
		The open nature of the box allows characters to leave the boundaries on either
		side, IE if a character passes beyond the right boundary, it will appear on the
		left side of the box. We utilize a cell structure that restrict computations
		between characters to only those in the same or neighboring cells. This significantly
		reduces the number of calculations in the box, especially for vision and collision
		calculations. Additionally, the box imposes a maximum speed and maximum number of
		characters, to avoid explosions of calculations. The user can specify the timestep
		and runtime, as well as how often to output a snapshot. If there is no change between
		timesteps, the simulation will terminate.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The simulation box calls a set of character functions for each character, calling
		the function for all characters before moving to the next function. In order, these
		are: aging the characters, calculate the vision values, interpret the vision to
		update the speed and orientation, spawn new characters, update the character energy,
		and as a last step, move and eat. This is parallelized to run concurrently by cell, with the
		exception of the "move" step. Every function prior to this one can be calculated
		independent of the other characters, but during the move step we check for collisions,
		and thus each character needs the up-to-date position to avoid colliding with a character
		that is no longer there.
              </p>
	      <h2>Character Object</h2>
	      <p>
		The character objects are the representation of predator and prey in the simulation,
		where each is a subclass of the character class. The only difference is prey have
		an infinite static food source randomly distributed throughout the box, whereas the
		predators have a food source of the prey class.
                <!-- <a href="/number_recognition/exploration">Data Exploration</a>. -->
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The characters by default have a few intrinsic properties, including: positions x & y,
		radius (all are circle shaped), a name, and whether it is consumed (deleted) by what eats it.
		Additionally, there are a number of attributes that can be activated by the user, allowing
		extra functionality. These are listed below at the end of this section.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		One of the vital character parameters is the vision. The vision object creates a set
		of rays oriented at different angles on either side of the characters orientation.
		The user can provide the center of these group of rays, and the total field of view.
		IE, if the user provides a FOV of 90 degrees, offset of 45 degrees, and 9 rays, the rays
		will all have a width of 10 degrees, and the "left" rays will be centered on (left to right)
		[85,75,65,55,45,35,25,15,5] degrees, and the "right" rays centered on
		[355,345,335,325,315,305,295,285,275] degrees. Any named object that the character can see
		that intersects one of these rays will be placed within it, and the closest values are
		used to determine changes in behavior.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		With the vision object, we can pair it with a Multi Layered Perceptron to train the
		predator and prey behavior, by outputting changes to speed and orientation as the final
		layer. We do this using a simple MLP to ensure we capture intended behavior or turning
		towards food, avoiding collisions, and avoiding predators. We those combine those with a
		MLP to construct a much stronger neural network that can weigh these decisions against
		each other.
