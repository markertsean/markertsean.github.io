	      <h2>Predator Prey Simulation (Updated April 2023)</h2>
	      <p>
		I wanted to try my hand in a re-enforcement learning project, so decided to
		try my hand at simulating predator/prey relationships.
                <!-- <a href="/number_recognition/exploration">Data Exploration</a>. -->
              </p>
	      <p>
		This is one of my largest projects, involving the creation of nearly 4000 lines
		of code covering object oriented programming, machine learning, simulation optimization,
		and re-enforcement learning.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The high end description of this project is simple - create a 2D simulation with
		predator objects that seek to hunt down prey objects, and prey that seek to not
		be eaten. The prey will also require food, which will be static circles that nourish them.
		This will require many things from these character objects - including the
		ability to interpret the simulated world around them, analyze their situation,
		and change their behavior accordingly. Not only this, but we need the simulation
		itself to be highly efficient to see major changes in behavior. I could have
		used a language other than python if I was concerned with efficiency (such as C/C++), however
		I was more interested in practicing my skills using python's native object oriented
		tools.
