	      <h2>Awards</h2>
	      <p>
		2015 NSF GK-12 Fellowship
	      </p>
	      <p>
		2014 NMSU Astronomy Pegasus Teaching Award
	      </p>
              <br/>

	      <h2>NSF GK-12 Fellowship</h2>
	      <p>
		Awarded the 2015
		<a href="https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/gk-12/">
		  National Science Foundation GK-12 Fellowship
		</a>
		through the NMSU computer science department.
		The goal and focus of this fellowship is to integrate
		principals of computer science into non-cs high school classrooms. 
		This was accomplished by developing my
		own unique lesson plans and assignments in conjunction with input from highschool teachers.
	      </p>
              <br/>

	      <h2>CS Adventures and YWIC Camp</h2>
	      <p>
		As part of the GK-12 Fellowship, I participated in the Computer Science Adventure
		Camp, and Young Women In Computing Camp in the Summer of 2016.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		For the CS Adventures Camp, I instructed middle school and junior high students in basic 
		programming techniques. I taught many concepts using block style programming with
		<a href="http://ozobot.com/">Ozobots</a>, led activities teaching binary using the card game
		Go-Fish, and even instructed students in data compression using an activity using 
		run length encoding.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		At the YWIC camp I was an assistant to an all woman staff of instructors as they taught
		middle school girls about computer science, programming, and engineering.

	      <h2>Astronomy Teaching Assistant</h2>
	      <p>
		I've been a graduate Teaching Assistant (TA) for Astro 105, 110, 305, 308,
		as well as the head TA, and observatory TA. The 105 and 110 classes are laboratory based,
		where I instructed and oversaw student groups, as well as 
		grading student lab packets and their summaries. The 300 level classes were focused more 
		primarily on the grading, with less student one on one interaction. As an observatory
		TA I was in charge of running the on campus observatory, which the 100 level students 
		are required to attend. As the head TA, my role focused on instructing new TAs how to
		perform labs, as well as best teaching practices based on my experience and understanding
		of student capabilities.
