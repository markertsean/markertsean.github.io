	      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
	      <p>
	        I am a data scientist and Ph.D. graduate in Astronomy from
                New Mexico State University. I currently work at
		<a href="https://www.redviolet.com/">Red Violet</a>,
		which provides information
		services linking people, criminal, asset, and business data.
		This requires highly efficient and technical solutions to
		clean, process, and match together tens of terabytes of data.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		For my doctoral research I worked with
		<a href="https://astro.nmsu.edu/facultydirectory/anatoly-klypin.html">Professor Anatoly Klypin</a>.
		My dissertation was to explore the techniques used to estimate
                the mass of galaxy clusters using weak gravitational lensing,
		using simulations from the <a href="http://www.multidark.org/">MultiDark suite</a>.
	      </p>

              <p>
                I'm always working on machine learning projects, if you're interested
                in those check out my <a href="projects">Project Portfolio</a>. I'm
                working on publishing everything I've worked on, so stay tuned as I
                add more.
              </p>
