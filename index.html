	      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
	      <p>
	
	        I am Ph.D. recipient in Astronomy from New Mexico State University, working with 
		<a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/directory/faculty/name/anatoly-klypin/">Professor Anatoly Klypin</a>. 
		My thesis work was to study the systematic effects of weak lensing density profile fitting of galaxy clusters,
		using simulations from the <a href="http://www.multidark.org/">MultiDark suite</a>.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		If you are interested in weak lensing or simulation surface density codes, check out my 
		<a href="code.html">codes</a> page or my 
		<a href="https://github.com/markertsean">Github</a> page.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		I've also created a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/markertsean">Kaggle profile</a>, 
		and am excited to start taking on their competitions. If you're looking for a teammate, I'm looking to explore and learn!
