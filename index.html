	      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
	      <p>
	
	        I am a Ph.D. graduate in Astronomy from New Mexico State University, who worked with
		<a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/directory/faculty/name/anatoly-klypin/">Professor Anatoly Klypin</a>.
		My dissertation was to explore the techniques used to estimate the mass of galaxy clusters using weak gravitational lensing,
		using simulations from the <a href="http://www.multidark.org/">MultiDark suite</a>. 
	      </p>
	      <p>
		If you are interested in weak lensing or simulation surface density codes, check out my 
		<a href="code/">codes</a> page or my 
		<a href="https://github.com/markertsean">Github</a> page.
	      </p>
	      <p>
                I am currently moving out of the field of astronomy, and moving into the field of data science.
                In the works is a project page where I will showcase my skills at analysis and predictive modeling
                using machine learning. I've also created a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/markertsean">Kaggle profile</a>, 
		and am excited to start taking on their competitions.
