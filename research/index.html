              <h2>Weak Gravitational Lensing of Clusters in Simulations</h2>
	      
	      <p>
                My dissertation was aimed at studying systematic effects the weak lensing observational methods used to 
                recover galaxy cluster masses. There were two major components to this dissertation: 
                implementing a more accurate density profile for mass estimation, and challenging the observational 
                assumption that the clusters are spherical. The former should result in more accurate
		mass estimations, with decreases in bias and standard deviations in predicted cluster masses.
		The later is an examination of a fundamental assumption - as non-spherical mass profiles
		causes major increases in the standard deviation of predicted masses, and mass along the line of sight
		increases both the bias and standard deviation.

		The NFW density profile is exclusively used to predict galaxy cluster masses, when fit to weak 
                lensing data (e.g. 
                <a href="#ref1">1</a>,

                <a href="#ref18">18</a>). 
                The NFW profile is used for it's many strengths, simple analytical form for the reduced 
                shear (our fit parameter), only one free variable (mass), and widespread use of the NFW 
                profile for two decades. The Einasto profile provides a better fit to halos
                (

                but has a significantly more complicated expression for the reduced shear, requiring 
                more computational resources, and the weak lensing solution for which was only recently derived 
                by <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>).

                <br>
                The second part of my dissertation struck at a significantly more fundamental aspect 
                of weak lensing mass estimation. This assumption is that all of the shear is only in 
                a radial component, or, equivalently, the halos are completely spherically symmetric. 
                Though a good first order approximation, halos have significant structure where this 
                approximation can break down. This problem is further exasperated when structure is 
                added to the line of sight, and even a spherical halo would experience significant noise 
                due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight.
	      </p>

              <h3>Procedure overview</h3>

	      <p>
		For this project, we examine ~5,300 dark matter galaxy cluster halos at a z~0.5, using the
		MultiDark Planck simulation. We fit three different mass profiles: the NFW profile (which
		is traditionally used in weak lensing mass estimation), a truncated NFW profile cutoff at the
		virial radius, and the Einasto profile.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		These fits are applied to spherical cutouts of the halos at the virial radius, a 10 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc cube centered on the halo,
		and the 10 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc cube with varying integration lengths along the line of sight, to
		a maximum of 400 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc. The spherical cutout gives us the best analysis of
		which density profile gives the most accurate masses. The 10 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc cube and
		longer integration lengths give an estimate of how masses along the line of sight introduce
		bias and spread to our fit masses, and carry implications for surveys that look deeper
		at galaxy clusters.

                We estimated tens of thousands of halo masses from MultiDark simulations using weak lensing
                analysis, and fitting our density profiles.
                Observationally the reduced shear, g<sub>tot</sub> is measured.
		But, the assumption of spherical halos equates this to g<sub>tan</sub>, the reduced shear
		components that are only sensitive to radial variations.
		This is required for the observational density profile fitting method.
		The actual relationship between these two is: g<sub>tot</sub><sup>2</sup> = g<sub>tan</sub><sup>2</sup> + g<sub>sec</sub><sup>2</sup>,
		where g<sub>sec</sub> is the reduced shear due to non-radial variations in the halo mass.
		To test this assumption, we fit both the tangent component of reduced shear g<sub>tan</sub>,
		and the total reduced shear (g<sub>tot</sub>)

              <h3>Results - Fitting Different Density Profiles</h3>

              <p>
                <br>
                First we will compare different density profiles. We see in Figure 2 a six
                panel grid, each panel containing fits to the true mass on the x-axis (M<sub>200</sub>)
		and the measured weak lensing mass on the y-axis (M<sub>wl</sub>). Each contains
		a 1:1 line in blue, and the best fit line as a red dash. The bias and standard deviation
		of each best fit line is in the lower right corner of each panel. The left panels are
		our spherical mass cutouts, fit only to the galaxy cluster, and the right panels
		are the 10 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc cubes, which contain local structure. The top panels are
		the truncated NFW profile, the middle are the standard NFW profile, and the bottom
		is the Einasto profile. These are fit to the total reduced shear, g<sub>tot</sub>,
		so match what observers actually measure.

              <p>
                <br>
		We see that for all density profiles there is a positive bias, and thus over prediction in mass.
		The truncated NFW profile performs the best, and Einasto profile the worst, and this also
		holds true for the standard deviation in the fits. With the introduction of local structure
		the spread and bias unsurprisingly increase, with no change in order of performance of the
		different models. These differences in spread and bias are statistically significant across all models.

                (what observers claim to measure). We see the same general trends as in Figure 1, however
                fits to this component show a significantly lower bias than the g<sub>tot</sub> fits, and lower
                spread with the inclusion of structure. This is the first indication of a difference
                in g<sub>tot</sub>/g<sub>tan</sub> fits, hitting at the second major purpose of the dissertation.


		In Figure 3 we see the same style of plot as in Figure 2, but fits to the spherically symmetric component g<sub>tan</sub> 
                (what observers claim to measure).
		We see the significantly lower bias than the g<sub>tot</sub> fits, as g<sub>tot</sub> >= g<sub>tan</sub>.
		Interestingly, we see increased spread on the spherical fits, but lower spread with the inclusion of structure.
		The resiliency of g<sub>tan</sub> over g<sub>tot</sub> with structure can be understood due to
		inhomogeneities in the 2D mass profile imposing a g<sub>sec</sub> component.

                  add uncorrelated structure along the line of sight, adding noise to the reduced shear
                  signal. This has a strong effect on the halos at low mass.

                Figure 4 presents the same style of plot as in Figure 2, fitting with longer integration lengths,
		for the NFW profile fits to g<sub>tot</sub>.
                Uncorrelated structure along the line of sight forms a major source of
                noise, and can have significant impact on the measured shear. For simplicity we will only show the
                results for the NFW profile, but the trend is the same across all profiles.
		As can be seen, with increasing 
                integration length more uncorrelated structure (junk) is added to the line of sight,
                increasing both the scatter and bias. This is a huge issue for the low mass halos,
		the most sensitive to the noise, rending many an order of magnitude high in estimated mass,
                and makes our distribution non-homoscedastic.

                observed), with no statistically significant changes in standard deviation between integration steps,
		and a homoscedastic spread across all masses. This indicates the noise induced by correlated structure does not
                contribute significantly to g<sub>tan</sub>. The immense difference in g<sub>tot</sub> and g<sub>tan</sub>

              <h3>Results - Relative Contributions from Shear Components</h3>

              <p>
                <br>
                To study the difference between g<sub>tot</sub> and g<sub>tan</sub>, we can examine the relative 
                contributions of the two components, where g<sub>tot</sub><sup>2</sup> = g<sub>tan</sub><sup>2</sup> + 
                g<sub>sec</sub><sup>2</sup>. We do this by averaging these values as a function of radius, using the
		raw 2D mass maps, and not fitting any profile to them. Figure 6
                shows the mean of the squared ratio of the two components g<sub>tan</sub> or g<sub>sec</sub> to
                g<sub>tot</sub>, as a function of radius for the halo. We binned this into three mass bins,
                with an equal number of bin members. The result is the fractional contribution of 
                g<sub>tan</sub> (solid) and g<sub>sec</sub> (dashed) to g<sub>tot</sub>, with the color being increased integration
                length (matter along the line of sight). We see that in the low mass bin (top), the
                contribution from g<sub>sec</sub> quickly increases at longer integration lengths. This is better
                understood by scaling by the halo virial radius, as in Figure 7 below.

                radius of each halo, so that the 1 on the x axis line up with the halo "edge".
		The black line (r<sub>vir</sub> cutoff) clearly
                shows that for the halo itself, the approximation of g<sub>tot</sub>=g<sub>tan</sub> is a good assumption, with
                the inner regions having (g<sub>tan</sub>/g<sub>tot</sub>)<sup>2</sup> > 0.9. However with the introduction 
                of local structure, the contributions from g<sub>sec</sub> increase, and at further integration lengths,
                the observational approximation breaks down quickly.

              <p>
                <strong>In conclusion</strong>, we estimated tens of thousands of simulated halos masses, 
                using weak 
                gravitational lensing observational methods. The NFW profile surprisingly outperforms the 
                Einasto profile in weak lensing mass estimation. Most importantly, the introduction of 
                structure along the line of sight breaks down the observational approximation of g<sub>tot</sub>=g<sub>tan</sub>.
                The uncorrelated structure along the line of sight adds noise to the secant component of 
                shear, reaching a similar level of contribution to the tangent component at a few virial radii
                for any large integration length.
                This is a massive barrier for observations, because many galaxy cluster lenses in surveys
		extend far further out than my maximum integration length of 400 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc distance, which as a distance alone
		would correlate with a redshift of z~0.1. At the time of this writing, some surveys extend to a redshift
		of z~0.55, which would correlate to an integration length of approximately 1.4 h<sup>-1</sup> Gpc. Weak lensing
		as a cluster mass estimating methodology must find a way to overcome inhomogeneities in their integration
		as surveys explore deeper redshifts.
