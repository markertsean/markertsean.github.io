	      <h2>Weak Gravitational Lensing of Clusters in Simulations</h2>
	      <p>
                My dissertation was aimed at studying the weak lensing observational methods used to 
                recover galaxy cluster masses. There were two major components to this dissertation: 
                implementing a more accurate density profile, and challenging the observational 
                assumption that the clusters are spherical.
	      </p>



	      <p>
                The first part of this project was conceptually straightforward, we know the Einasto 
                density profile provides a better fit to dark matter halos in simulations (for the 
                non-astronomers, I will refer to galaxy clusters as halos). Despite this, the NFW 
                density profile is exclusively used to predict galaxy cluster masses, when fit to weak 
                lensing data
                (e.g. 
                <a href="#ref1">1</a>, 
                <a href="#ref2">2</a>, 
                <a href="#ref3">3</a>, 
                <a href="#ref7">7</a>, 
                <a href="#ref9">9</a>, 
                <a href="#ref14">14</a>, 
                <a href="#ref15">15</a>, 
                <a href="#ref16">16</a>, 
                <a href="#ref17">17</a>, 
                <a href="#ref18">18</a>). 
                The NFW profile is used for it's many strengths, simple analytical form for the reduced 
                shear (fit parameter), only one free variable (mass), and widespread use of the NFW 
                profile for two decades. The Einasto profile provides a better fit
                (
                <a href="#ref4">4</a>, 
                <a href="#ref5">5</a>, 
                <a href="#ref6">6</a>, 
                <a href="#ref8">8</a>, 
                <a href="#ref10">10</a>, 
                <a href="#ref13">13</a>),
                but has a significantly more complicated expression for the reduced shear, requiring 
                more computational resources, and the weak lensing solution was only recently derived 
                by <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>.
	      </p>
	      <p>
                The second part of my dissertation struck at a significantly more fundamental aspect 
                of weak lensing mass estimation. This assumption is that all of the shear is only in 
                a radial component, or, equivalently, the halos are completely spherically symmetric. 
                Though a good first order approximation, halos have significant structure where this 
                approximation can break down. This problem is further exasperated when structure is 
                added to the line of sight, and even a spherical halo would experince significant noise 
                due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight.

              <h3>Results</h3>
              <p>
                We estimated tens of thousands of halo masses from MultiDark simulations using weak lensing
                analysis. We fit the traditional NFW density profile, a NFW profile I modified, and the 
                Einasto density profile. Furthermore, we fit to the reduced shear components that are only 
                sensitive to radial variations (g_tan), and the total reduced shear (g_tot), to test the
                observational approximation that galaxy clusters can be approximated as spheres. 
                Observationally, g_tot is measured, but they claim to only measure g_tan, which is required 
                for the observational density profile fitting method.
              </p>

              <p>
                First lets look at the results for different density profiles. We see in Figure 1 a six
                panel grid, the left column is only considering the spherical halo (cutoff at the 
                virial radius), and the right column including local structure within 10 h^-1 Mpc.
                The top row is my modified NFW density profile, mid is the NFW profile, and bottom is
                the Einasto profile. On the x axis is the mass of the halos from the simulation, or the
                "true" mass of the halo. The y axis is the predicted mass from the density profile
                fitting of the reduced shear from weak lensing. The blue line is the 1:1 fit line,
                and the red dashed line the line of best fit. Figure 1 is a fit to the total reduced 
                shear, or what observers actually measure.

              <p>
                We see that for all density profiles, the sphere cutoff gives overall a similar result
                as the estimations with local structure included. The bias of the fit (beta) and spread
                (sigma) increase with introduction of local structure, the increase is not huge, but is
                statistically significant. Furthermore, we see the modified NFW profile has the tightest
                spread and lowest bias of the three distributions, with the Einasto having the worst 
                performance. The absolute bias here is less interesting than the relative spread between
                the profiles, as the bias is dependent on the fit parameters used, and we are mostly 
                interested in the tightness of the spread of the distribution.
              </p>

              <p>
                In Figure 2 we see the same fits, but to the spherically symmetric component g_tan 
                (what observers claim to measure). We see the same general trends as in Figure 1, however
                fits to this component show a significantly lower bias than the g_tot fits, and lower
                spread with the inclusion of structure. This is the first indication of a difference
                in g_tot/g_tan fits, hitting at the second major purpose of the dissertation.
              </p>

              <p>
                We tested this same analysis by performing fitting with longer integration lengths,
                which includes uncorrelated structure along the line of sight. This is a source of
                noise, and can have significant impact on the measured shear. We will only show the
                results for the NFW profile, for simplicity. In Figure 3 we show the fits to g_tot 
                for increasing integration lengths. The integration length increases across the rows,
                and the top left panel is the same as in Figure 1. As can be seen, with increasing 
                integration length more uncorrelated structure (junk) is added to the line of sight,
                increasing both the scatter and bias. This is a huge issue for the low mass halos, 
                the most sensitive to the noise, and makes our distribution no-homoscedastic.
              </p>

              <p>
                Figure 4 shows the same as Figure 3, but as a fit to g_tan, what observers claim to
                observe. This demonstrates a dramatic difference to the g_tot case (what is actually
                observed), with no statistically significant spread change, and a homoscedastic spread
                across all masses.
              </p>

              <p>
                To study the difference between g_tot and g_tan, we can examine the relative 
                contributions of the two components, where g_tot^2 = g_tan^2 + g_sec^2. Figure 5
                shows the azimuthal mean of the squared ratio of the two components g_tan/g_sec to
                g_tot, as a function of radius for the halo. We binned this into three mass bins,
                with an equal number of bin members. The result is the fractional contribution of 
                g_tan (solid) and g_sec (dashed) to g_tot, with the color being increased integration
                length (junk along the line of sight). We see that in the low mass bin (top), the
                contribution from g_sec quickly dominates at longer integration lengths. This is better
                understood by scaling by the halo's virial readius, as in Figure 6.
              </p>

              <p>
                We see in Figure 6 the same as in Figure 5, but with the radius scaled to the virial
                radius of each halo, so that 1 is the halo "edge". The black line (r_vir cutoff) clearly
                shows that for the halo itself, the approximation of g_tot=g_tan is perfectly valid, with
                even the inner regions having (g_tan/g_tot)^2 > 0.9. However with the introduction 
                of local structure, the contributios from g_sec increase, and at further integration lengths,
                the observational approximation breaks down quickly.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>In conclusion</strong>, we estimated tens of thousands of simulated halos masses, 
                using weak 
                gravitational lensing observational methods. The NFW profile surprisingly outperforms the 
                Einasto profile in weak lensing mass estimation. Most importantly, the introduction of 
                structure along the line of sight breaks down the observational approximation of g_tot=g_tan.
                This is a huge problem in observations, because we observe lensing using long integration
                lengths, including lots of uncorrelated structure.
