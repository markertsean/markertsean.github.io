	      <p>
	        Welcome to my project page! This is where I will be link to all of
                my personal machine learning projects. I'm building this portfolio
                now (updated 2/20/18), and have lots of projects I need to write up 
                and add to this page. As I upload projects old and new, this is 
                where they will go. I'm currrently working on the pages for the
                Coming Soon section, but there are more projects to come...

                <strong><a href="/python_trader">Stock Forecasting with Python</a></strong><br>
                This is my project aimed at accurately predicting stock prices and trends.
                This is an ongoing project, and I will be building upon this project as time goes 
                on. Upadated (10/14/17).

                <strong><a href="/trupanion_interview_project">
                    Monthly Cancellations for Pet Insurance
                </a></strong><br>
                This was an interview project I was presented with. The goal was to
                predict which customers cancel their policies in January 2017,
                with limited customers and claims information. I explore both
                machine learning and survival analysis to predict the lifetime of
                customer accounts. Published with permission from the Trupanion.
                Updated (11/14/17).
