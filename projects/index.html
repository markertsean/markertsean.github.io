	      <p>
	        Welcome to my project page! This is where I will be link to all of
                my personal machine learning projects. I'm building this portfolio
                now (updated 5/23), and have lots of projects I need to write up
                and add to this page. As I upload projects old and new, this is
                where they will go.

		Here I use reinforcement learning to create AI prey and AI predators, who
		both attempt to survive and compete against each other.

		This is a personal, ongiong project to predict the performance of players
		in fantasy football. In it's current state, the	program operates only on teams,
		and not individual players, but does a good job predicting team performance.

		This was a project done as part of my fellowship with the Insight program.
		From start to finish, I developed a product that could identify a group of
		Legos, and using them, recommend a set to build. For more detail

                Here I take a crack at that classic problem, recognizing images of numbers.
                I use the MNIST dataset in a Kaggle competition, and focus on exploring the
                differences between modeling with Scikit-Learn's Multi Layered Peceptron, and
                TensorFlow.

                This was an interview project I was presented with. The goal was to
                predict which customers cancel their policies in January 2017,
                with limited customers and claims information. I explore both
                machine learning and survival analysis to predict the lifetime of
                customer accounts. Published with permission from the Trupanion.
