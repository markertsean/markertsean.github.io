	      <p>
	        Welcome to my project page! This is where I will be link to all of
                my personal machine learning projects. I'm building this portfolio
                now (updated 11/14/17), and have lots of projects I need to write up 
                and add to this page. As I upload projects old and new, this is 
                where they will go. I'm currrently working on the pages for the
                Coming Soon section, but there are more projects to come...

                This is my project aimed at accurately predicting stock prices and trends.
                This is an ongoing project, and I will be building upon this project as time goes

              <p>
                <strong><a href="/trupanion_interview_project">Monthly Cancellations for Pet Insurance</strong><br>
                This was an interview project I was presented with. The goal was to
                predict which customers cancel their policies in January 2017,
                with limited customers and claims information. I explore both
                machine learning and survival analysis to predict the lifetime of
                customer accounts. Published with permission from the Trupanion.
