	      <h2>Predicting the top performing teams</h2>
	      <p>
		The absolute predictions of these algorithms are not the most important metric to judge
		them by, it is the relative performance of the teams that matters.
		We really need to have the ranking of performances correctly, so we will test these
		algorithms by seeing how accurately we can predict the top 3 teams.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		For a selection of three teams out of 32 in the NFL, the likelihood of randomly drawing
		one of the top three in a given metric is 9.4%. To randomly guess all three correctly,
		the likelihood is 0.020%. These serve as a baseline to compare our precision and recall
		metric with, though there is not a 1 to 1 comparison we can make between the values.
		There are more than three teams that can appear in the top teams, as say, if no team fumbles
		the ball in a given week, you would have 32 teams in the "top 3" for fumbles for the week.
		We will however use the precision and recall metric for "team in the top three" for a week,
		for our	test data set over 2020-2022.

		Some of the fields only make sense to compare the top 1, or best performing. In cases like fumbles, where many teams
		may only be at 0, this category will be crowded and useless as a top 3. We provide that result below, and recommend
		comparing against a simple 3.12% chance of guessing randomly the top performing team.

		Comparing our metrics against the random samples, it's clear most of our forecasts at least approximate
		better than random guessing. We are capturing a signal, and able to predict based on it.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		However, there is a big difference between being able to predict values, and the predictions being useful.
		In some cases the top performers are predicted at twice the rate as they should be. While not a terrible
		performance on paper, someone having a pen and pencil following players and teams can likely perform on a
		similar or better level than this algorithm with simple assumptions.

		This project is an ongoing one, and I've already outlined places for improvements. I will update these pages
		when appropriate, and when results improve.

                The number of complete passes per game displays a shape similar to the normal distribution.
